## RideBooking API Documentation for Frontend Developers

This guide will walk you through how to use the API for booking rides using frameworks such as Flutter, React Native, or any other frontend framework. The RideBooking API allows users to book rides, cancel bookings, request driver cancellations, and manage ride statuses. 

### NOTE to ENOS
In the inital stages you have to save user ID when the user is signing to allow the user to make a request, also make sure to saving the bookingid (booking._id) after you receive a response from a successful booking request. (bookingID (booking._id), userID (user._id), DriverID (driver._id)).

### NOTE TO GEORGE
Also you will have to manage the IDs throughout the app ( DriverID (driver._id)). You will save the driverID when the driver signs in this id is going to be provided in the response.
The you can use ENDPONTS 8 AND 9 to retrive booking information and user information. You can decide how many times you want to call this end point to check if the driver has any new booking (endpoint 8 at the bottom of this page). 


Example of how the id's generated by mongoDB look like:
